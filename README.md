#  RoomFinderPro

This is a sample iOS project that demonstrates machine learning concepts through the use of the iOS 11 Vision framework. The sample use case of the app is to allow Capital One users to reserve conference rooms using their phone by taking a photo of the placard in front of a conference room.

The project uses the Vision framework to detect text regions in the image and then runs those regions through an OCR engine to convert the images into usable text.

*Note: This a demonstration project only and is not actually integrated with Exchange to complete the room booking process*

## Requirements
* Xcode 9.0+
* iOS 11+
* Universal iOS Support
